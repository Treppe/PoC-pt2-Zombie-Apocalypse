## Phase 1 - Apocalypse Class

In phase one, we will implement the basic methods for the Apocalypse class. We suggest that you start from [this template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_zombie_template.py). Note that the Apocalypse class is a subclass of the [Grid class](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_grid.py) and inherits all of its methods.

The template contains an implementation of the _ _init_ _ method for the Apocalypse class. The initializer takes two required arguments grid_height and grid_width. The initializer also takes three optional arguments obstacle_list, zombie_list, and human_list which are lists of cells that initially contain obstacles, zombies and humans, respectively. For phase one, your task is to implement the remaining seven Apocalypse methods:

### 1. def clear(self):

Reset all cells in the grid to be passable and reinitialize the human and zombie lists to be empty. Remember that you can use the clear method from the poc_grid. Grid class to clear the grid of impassable cells. Examine the implementation of the _ _init_ _ method for how to call this method.

### 4. def zombies(self)

Generator that allows you to iterate over zombies in the zombie list. Here, a zombie is a tuple of the form (row,col) indicating the zombie's location in the grid. The generator **must** yield the zombies in the order they were added (even if they have moved). Remember that you can use a generator to implement this method in one or two lines of code.

### 7. def humans(self)
